## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

year <- 2017:2020
quarters <- 1:4
type <- "Electric"

pge_20_elec <- NULL
for(year in years){for(quarter in quarters) {
  
  filename <- 
    paste0(
      "pge/PGE_",
      year,
      "_Q",
      quarter,
      "_",
      type,
      "UsageByZip.csv"
    )

  print(filename)
  
  temp <- read_csv(filename)
  
  pge_20_elec <- rbind(pge_20_elec,temp)
  # Note rbind requires field names to be consistent for every new thing that you add.

  saveRDS(pge_20_elec, "pge_20_elec.rds")}

}
pge_filter <- filter(pge_20_elec, CUSTOMERCLASS %in% c("Elec- Residential","Elec- Commercial"))
```
